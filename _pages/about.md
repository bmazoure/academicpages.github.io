# About me

I am currently a PhD student at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and McGill University, co-supervised by Devon Hjelm and Doina Precup. My research interests include deep reinforcement learning, probabilistic modeling, variational inference and representation learning.

I have completed my Master's in Statistics at McGill University under the supervision of Prof. [Johanna Neslehova](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/neslehova/). My thesis focuses on reconstructing graphical models from discrete data with variational inference and multiarmed bandits. It can be found here: [link][https://bmazoure.github.io/files/thesis_Msc_2018.pdf].

I was also a research intern at Nuance during the summer of 2018 where I collaborated with Dr. [Atta Norouzian](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=KRPMXqYAAAAJ&hl=en). My work there focused on modeling acoustic signals such as speech with deep neural architectures.

Previously, I obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Statistics in 2017 from McGill University.
