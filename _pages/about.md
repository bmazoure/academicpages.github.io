# News

* <img src="/files/driml/fig7-model-01.png" alt="preview" width="200"/> Our paper **Deep Reinforcement and InfoMax Learning** [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07217)][[blog](https://bmazoure.github.io/posts/deep-rl-infomax-learning/)] [poster](/files/driml/DRIML_poster_(NeurIPS2020).pdf) is accepted to NeurIPS 2020 as a poster.

# About me

I am currently a PhD student at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and McGill University, co-supervised by [Devon Hjelm](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=68c5HfwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Doina Precup](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=j54VcVEAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include deep reinforcement learning, probabilistic modeling, variational inference and representation learning.

Currently, I am part-time at Microsoft Research, working on counterfactual evaluation in contextual bandits.
I was a research intern at Microsoft Research, New York in the reinforcement learning team during Summer 2020. Previously, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Montreal in the reinforcement learning team during Summer 2019. I was also a research intern at Nuance during the summer of 2018 where I collaborated with [Atta Norouzian](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=KRPMXqYAAAAJ&hl=en). My work there focused on modeling acoustic signals such as speech with deep neural architectures.

I have completed my Master's in Statistics at McGill University under the supervision of [Johanna Neslehova](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/neslehova/). My thesis focused on reconstructing graphical models from discrete data with variational inference and multiarmed bandits. It can be found here: [link](https://bmazoure.github.io/files/thesis_Msc_2018.pdf). Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Statistics in 2017 from McGill University.
