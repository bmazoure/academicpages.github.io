# About me

Currently pursuing Master's in Statistics at McGill University under the supervision of Prof. [Johanna Neslehova](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/neslehova/). My thesis focuses on reconstructing graphical models from discrete data with variational auto-encoders and multiarmed bandits. 

I am also a research scientist at Nuance during the summer of 2018 where I collaborate with Dr. [Atta Norouzian](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=KRPMXqYAAAAJ&hl=en). My work there focuses on modeling acoustic signals such as speech with deep neural architectures.

Previously, I obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Statistics in 2017 from McGill University.

# Research interests

* Deep and distributional reinforcement learning;

* Multivariate statistics;

* Parametric and Non-parametric Bayesian methods (Gaussian processes and variational inference);

* Probabilistic graphical models;

* Uncertainty representation in neural networks;

* Generative models (auto-encoding variational Bayes and generative nets);

* Dependence modeling for discrete marginals (in connection to Master's thesis).
